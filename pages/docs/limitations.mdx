# Limitations
This research faced logistical and time constraints. The time frame of one academic semester did not allow this research to develop both theory and methodology in greater depth respectively. The part concerning how humans perceive and perceive sound experience requires the survey of a vast literature from different perspectives and approaches, which I believe is necessary to have covered for the further development of this research. The training of DL models requires enormous computational power, which depends on both the size of the input data set and the size of the ANN. For optimal training of ANN models, state-of-the-art computing hardware and GPU graphics cards are used , to which I do not have access.  Hence, this research was completed with the minimum computing power available to me and partly made use of the free computing power offered by google colab research in the free program, but with a limited amount of data.
